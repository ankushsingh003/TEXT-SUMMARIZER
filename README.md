# TEXT-SUMMARIZER
Built a GenAI-based text summarization system using Hugging Face PEGASUS and Transformers, capable of generating concise, high-quality summaries from long-form text. Implemented data preprocessing, tokenization, and model inference in Python/Colab, leveraging PyTorch and NLTK for efficient NLP workflow.
